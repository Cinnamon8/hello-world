First steps on GitHub
Retired Teacher, retired from teaching Design Technology in a UK High School.
Familiar with BASIC, PIC programming,Analogue & Digital Electronics up to KS4 and a tad beyond.
Bought one of the first batch of Raspberry Pi's and played around with Python coding...limited capability just yet.
Own 4 Pi's, considering Pi 3 as a step forward.
Thought I'd investigate the often-quoted GitHub.
